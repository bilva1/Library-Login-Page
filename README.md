# Library-Login-Page
Developing the frontend of a library's login page using HTML and CSS.

index.html:-
The HTML code establishes the structure of the library login page. It begins with a standard Document Type Declaration (DOCTYPE) specifying the HTML version. The head section includes essential meta tags for character set and viewport settings, as well as the title of the page, set to "Library Login." External resources are linked, such as the "index.css" stylesheet for styling and the Boxicons library for icon integration. The body section comprises a wrapper div that serves as the main container, housing a form with input fields for "username" and "password", a "Remember me" checkbox, a "Forgot Password?" link, a login button, and a registration link. This structure ensures a logically organized and semantically sound foundation for the visual elements.

index.css:-
Global styles are established to reset default spacing and introduce a specific font family, "Poppins," for a consistent text appearance throughout the page.
The body of the page is configured as a flex container, employing the display: flex property. This facilitates the centering of content both horizontally and vertically, ensuring a well-balanced layout.
The primary styling focuses on the wrapper, the main container encompassing the login form. The wrapper is given a width, borders, and a semi-transparent background with a blurred effect achieved through the "backdrop-filter" property. To enhance the visual depth, a subtle box shadow is applied. These styling elements collectively create a visually appealing and distinct container.
The input boxes for the username and password are styled for a clean and modern appearance. They have a transparent background, eliminating borders to enhance the sleek look. Rounded corners are introduced using the "border-radius" property. Additionally, icons are strategically positioned within the input boxes using the position and transform properties.
Button styles are defined with specific dimensions, a contrasting background color, and rounded corners, contributing to a friendly and clickable appearance. Similarly, links are styled for a cohesive and user-friendly design making use of "hover" state.
Overall, the CSS code serves as a set of instructions that dictate the appearance of each element on the page, from the main container to individual input fields and buttons. The combination of these styles results in a well-crafted and visually appealing library login page.
